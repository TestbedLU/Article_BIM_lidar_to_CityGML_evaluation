# Article_BIM_lidar_to_CityGML_evaluation

This repository contains FME workbenches from the submitted manuscript "Evaluating geometric aspects of integrating BIM models into city models". The FME workbenches convert building information models (BIM) in IFC format to CityGML geometires. Since the aim of the study is to compare the geometries of CityGML building models created from BIM models with CityGML building models created from lidar data the transformation is on geometry level only; no attributes are mapped to create valid CityGML models. 

The CityGML building models are created in LOD1.2, LOD1.3 and LOD2.3 according to the detailed LOD definitions suggested by:
